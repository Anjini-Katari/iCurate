# iCurate
An Angular 9 web interface for *iCURATE*. A [live version](https://www.nybg.org/files/scientists/dlittle/icurate/) is hosted at the New York Botanical Garden.

*iCURATE* mobilizes the plant identification models produced in the [Herbarium2019](https://www.kaggle.com/c/herbarium-2019-fgvc6) and [Herbarium2020](https://www.kaggle.com/c/herbarium-2020-fgvc7) Kaggle competitions so that botanists can easily make identifications from herbarium specimen images without needing to install or build their own neural networks.

### install
`npm install icurate --save`

### use
`util/angular-dev.sh` will start a local dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
